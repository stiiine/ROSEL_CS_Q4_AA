				<br><br>
				<h2 id="shortdesc"> A trade secret is any practice or process of a company that is generally not known outside of the company. Information considered a trade secret gives the company a competitive advantage over its competitors and is often a product of internal research and development. </h2>

		<h1 id="titol"> What makes information qualify as a trade secret?</h1>
				<br><br>
		<h2 id="shortdesc">Laws in most U.S. states define a trade secret as any formula, pattern, physical device, idea, process or compilation of information that both provides the owner of that information with an advantage in the marketplace, and is managed in a way that demonstrates the owner intends to prevent the public or competitors from learning about it, stealing it or using it.
	
To be legally considered a trade secret in the United States, a company must make a reasonable effort in concealing the information from the public; the secret must intrinsically have economic value, and the trade secret must contain information. Trade secrets are a part of a company's intellectual property. Unlike a patent, a trade secret is not publicly known.</h2>

		<h1 id="titol"> Understanding a trade secret </h1>
				<br><br>
		<h2 id="shortdesc"> Trade secrets are defined differently based on jurisdiction, but all have the following characteristics in common:<br><br>
	<ul  style="margin-left:70px;">
	<li>They are not public information.</li>
	<li>Their secrecy provides an economic benefit to their holder.</li>
	<li>heir secrecy is actively protected.</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>

			If a trade secret holder fails to safeguard the secret or if the secret is independently discovered, released, or becomes general knowledge, protection of the secret is removed.<br><br><br>

To protect its trade secrets, a company may require employees privy to the information to sign non-compete or non-disclosure agreements (NDA) upon hire.</h2>

<h1 id="titol"> How are trade secrets managed?</h1>
<br><br>
<h2 id="shortdesc"> Trade secrets are established and managed in much different ways than the other types of IP we’ve covered in this blog series, including copyrights, trademarks and patents. A trade secret does not need to be registered in any way to be effective, and there is no time limit on its protection.<br><br><br>

However, there are some conditions you must keep in mind if you believe you have business information that can be considered a trade secret. The information must not be generally known by or accessible to people in your business who typically deal with such information, it must have commercial value in its secrecy and it must be managed with reasonable efforts to keep it secret. These efforts may include labeling related documents as “confidential,” ensuring adequate computer security and keeping the information locked in a safe.<br><br><br>

 If you have a trade secret, you should also keep in mind the disadvantages of this type of IP. A trade secret is more difficult to enforce than other forms of IP, and the kind of protection afforded to trade secrets is comparatively weak and can vary from country to country. It is also important to note that a competing business may discover and patent the very same information you’d developed and maintained as a trade secret.<br><br><br>
